It seems these tests can't be run in an automated way against the software.

# Comment
Based on ISO 19105 and the OGC Specification Model, each Markdown document represents a test case. A test case is part of a conformance class, which in turn is part of an abstract test suite for a specification document.
The current material seems to use 'ATS' where 'Conformance Class' is probably meant. The information which conformance classes form an ATS is, however, not represented. 
In this context it is important to emphasize that conformance class is the key concept. An ATS is far less important as it is just the aggregation of all the conformance classes in a specification.
In addition, the term 'ATS' is sometimes also used for a test case.
# Proposed Change
Use 'Conformance Class' (or 'CC'/'cc') where 'Abstract Test Suite' (or 'ATS'/'ats') is used now - and where the Technical Guidance includes (implicitly or explicitly) a conformance class. Avoid using wrong a misleading term for test cases.
Group the conformance classes into ATSs based on the specifications that define the conformance classes.
I.e., the structure would be for the current 'ATS's:
ATS: TG View Service 3.11
CC: WMS 1.3.0 profile
TC: A.02.IR04.extended...
TC: A.03.IR05.schema...
TC: ... (no more test cases shown below)
CC: WMTS 1.0.0 profile
ATS: TG Discovery Service 3.1
CC: CSW 2.0.2 ISO AP profile
 ATS: TG Download Service 3.1
CC: Pre-defined Atom
CC: Pre-defined WFS 2.0.0
CC: Direct WFS 2.0.0

CC: ISO 19115/19119 profile
ATS: TG Spatial Data Services 3.1
CC: Invocable Spatial Data Services 
CC: Interoperable Spatial Data Services
CC: Harmonized Spatial Data Services 
Notes:
TG View Services: The document does not explicitly specify conformance classes for the two OGC standards, but implicitly these are defined as 'profiles'.

# Comment
An ATS belongs to a specification. Therefore, the references in a test case may only reference one specification. 
However, currently sometimes an IR and a TG are referenced. This is not consistent with the notion of conformance classes or abstract test suites. Since IRs do not specify conformance classes and this is typically done in a technical guidance document, the reference should go to the TG (and the requirement in the TG should reference the relevant parts of the IR).

For each test case, identify/reference the relevant requirements in the TG document that specifies the conformance class.

# Comment
It would be very useful to clarify for each test case which messages should be reported in case of identified errors in the test object.
While the description of a test case should be independent from both the implementation and the values, the test case 'should be complete in the sense that it is sufficient to enable a test verdict to be assigned unambiguously to each potentially observable test outcome (i.e. sequence of test events)' (see ISO 19105). This level of completeness would imply that the potential verdicts / messages can be derived easily from the test case description. 
In some cases this is trivial, but in general there is a risk that the messages implemented in an ETS may not contain the information that the ATS authors expect.

For each test case, specify the messages (including the variable information derived from the test object) that should be reported.";emidiostani

The test type is mostly 'automated', but some test are 'manual' or it is unclear. However, in some cases a requirement is considered 'not testable' where a manual test might be possible.

Unfortunately we had not had enough time to go through all documents, but we have found parts of the document that are too general. They should be more specific if the purpose is to be able to validate Inspire conformance.
The following example is taken from ATS metadata.
- A04 is an example of too general text;
Test method
Checks if a resource type (hierarchyLevel) is provided and is taken from the MD_ScopeCode codelist.
To be relevant for INSPIRE the value should be either 'dataset', 'service' or 'series'
This test is relevant for Inspire, so the value should just consist of 'dataset', 'service' or 'series'
- A24 is an example of when the test is written more precise (good example);
Test method
The test first checks if there is at least one role element. The element must contain an element at gmd:CI_RoleCode[@codeListValue=x], where x is one of the values described in ISO 19115, chapter B.5.5.

Also, clearly identify which Conformance Class / ATS needs to be passed by the document retrieved from the MetadataURL or by the ExtendedCapabilities element.

The Technical Guidance for INSPIRE Discovery Services also provides codes for the EFTA countries while Technical Guidelines for INSPIRE metadata provides codes only for the EU Member States' to be even more specific what does not comply with each (see the word in bold)

The Prerequisite does not make sense because:
- it puts a condition on the metadata document that will be fetched during the test.The condition it describes should be moved to the Test Method.
-it assumes that what comes back is an ISO 19139 document while it could be a Capabilities document.
The 'equivalent' for Network Services is the Get Network Service Metadata Response document which is often an OGC Capabilities document.

# Comment
The ATS requires validation against three different XSD schema versions (at least one should pass). It is not clear how to determine which schema to use to validate the document.
# Proposed Change
The ATS should perhaps clarify that this is on the basis of the declared namespaces in the XML document (see also issue 10 on GitHub), i.e.:
If the document declares http://www.isotc211.org/2005/srv, use http://schemas.opengis.net/csw/2.0.2/profiles/apiso/1.0.0/apiso.xsd.
But otherwise, it is unclear what to use. The official schema for http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd is http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/ISO_19139_Schemas/gmd/gmd.xsd or http://schemas.opengis.net/iso/19139/20070417/gmd/gmd.xsd, but in the context of Discovery services, INSPIRE also uses http://schemas.opengis.net/iso/19139/20060504/gmd/gmd.xsd.

# Comment
In the sentence:
 'Checks if a resource type (hierarchyLevel) is provided and is taken from the MD_ScopeCode codelist.'
MD_ScopeCode is a link that points to the INSPIRE Codelist(*) (**)
However, the MD TG maps the INSPIRE values to the already existing original ISO values.
So the codelist values are simply a subset of those defined in B.5.25 MD_ScopeCode <<CodeList>>

(*)The INSPIRE codelist contains the value 'services' that was amended into 'service' in the MD Regulation Corrigendum).
(**) The INSPIRE codelist makes available codes that are absolute HTTP URIs (e.g. http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ResourceType/dataset ) while in ISO 19139 you need just the term 'dataset'. The INSPIRE codelist does not make the term available on its own.
# Proposed Change
Remove the link to the INSPIRE Codelist and reference instead table B.5.25 MD_ScopeCode <<CodeList>> of ISO 19115.

-The Purpose does not make it clear when and if the test succeeds or fails.
Purpose: If a linkage is available, a resource locator must be given. If the resource is a service, the linkage should be checked.

-How do I know 'if a linkage is available to the resource' if I do not test the link? So, when does the test succeed and when is it to be considered failed?

- The term resource in 'If the resource is a service,' actually does not refer to the dataset metadata but to the resource found at the URL being tested. It would be better to make this clearer.

- What about URLs that are accessible only inside the intranet of an organisation?

-What about the case when no linkage to the dataset is provided but the same dataset is found referenced by a Network Service described in a service metadata coming from the same catalogue?
-What if more than one View Service offers the dataset? Shouldn't there be a National View Service (even just a proxy) of reference for each viewable dataset?


# Proposed Change
Rephrase the Purpose as follows:
Purpose: This test checks each resource locator URL to see if it is syntactically correct and if the resource it references can be accessed, in order to determine its type.
If the referenced resource is recognized as a Network Service, it checks whether the linkage to the dataset is declared and implemented.";emidiostani

# Comment
In the Test Method, the expression 'The URL is resolved.' The use of the word resolved is misleading. 
To resolve a URL means to resolve it to an IP address while the intended meaning here is (ref. https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/ats-metadata/blob/master/README.md#resolve )
'Resolve: Goal is to check if a URL references an existing document. First the URL can be checked on syntactical correctness. Then a http head operation can give an indication of the availability of the document without fully downloading it. The operation might fail due to a number of reasons: the service is (temporarily) unavailable, the service is protected (status 403).'
So, we have the following checks:
- the URL is checked for syntactical correctness;
- the resource is accessed to check if it is accessible
The suggestion of using a HTTP HEAD operation is not acceptable because:
- servers and services do not implement the HEAD operation consistently;
- the response is not enough to identify Network Services or Harmonised Spatial Data Services.
The following reference to a WSDL is unclear. OGC Services for which SOAP binding is implemented, still respond with a capabilities document:
'Any service response should be checked if it provides proper linkage. The service wsdl or capabilities document should have a featuretype that shares the resource unique identification'

The following hint is not complete and not correct for all service types. In addition, the linkage is always also implemented via MetadataURLs in all the services which is therefore the preferred way.
'if WMS/WMTS/WFS, the link is in //layer[identifier={id}&&@authority={codespace}] if Atom, the link is in //feed[@uuidhref={id}&&@namespace={codespace}]'

How is the following part relevant for the test outcome?
'a final manual test is suggested to the tester (to test if any of the linkages points to a webpage with further instructions or a client application that directly accesses the service).'

# Proposed Change
Change the Test method as follows:

The test checks if a linkage is provided.
If none is given, the test will complete successfully.
If one or more are provided, for each linkage the test checks:
-  if the linkage element contains an element of type gmd:URL.
- if the element content is a syntactically correct URL
- if the referenced resource is accessible.

If the response identifies the linkage as a Harmonised Spatial Data Service or a Network Service, the test checks if appropriate linkage to dataset is available.
The linkage is established via the Metadata URL for WMS, WFS and Atom based services.

 a final manual test is suggested to the tester (to test if any of the linkages points to a webpage with further instructions or a client application that directly accesses the service).

Note: The test could perhaps explicitly test if the code list is identified by the URI: http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/ . The US Library of Congress is the officially mandated organisation to maintain ISO639.
Note: Another prerequisite is test case A.04.

The part of the test method that talks about validating the keyword against the thesaurus when its URL is available is out of place since it is not in any requirement.

As formulated now, the test result does not depend on the outcome of the first test on TimePeriod, so even in case of an invalid TimePeriod, the test will pass.

I think it has to be the other way round: The test regarding TG Req. 23 will be passed only if at least one of the three date-checks is valid.

# Comment
Coverage: The IR05 seems to require testing in the first place whether the Capabilities document can be retrieved using valid HTTP request parameters. This requires that the GetCapabilities request should be tested without specifying a language parameter (default language) and also for all LANGUAGE parameters that the service provides. 
Furthermore, the test should only succeed if the Capabilities document does not contain an exception (i.e. the response can be valid against the WMS Capabilities schema when containing an exception).
# Proposed Change
First, the test should retrieve the Capabilities document using the default language (without language parameter). 
Different outcomes are possible:
- HTTP error (e.g.4XX or 5XX) response: the test fails;
- HTTP 200 response, but with service exception document: the test fails;
- HTTP 200 response with capabilities document that validates against the ISO 19128 schema: the test succeeds. 
Second, the GetCapabilities request should be repeated for all supported languages.  (>> update: this is done in test A.40)
- HTTP 4XX response: the test fails;
- HTTP 200 response, but with service exception document: the test fails;
- HTTP 200 response with capabilities document that validates against the ISO 19128 schema: the test succeeds if the language is current. ";emidiostani

Coverage: There is no test case for IR17. However, it is not clear why this requirement is not testable. Is this because the test result would always succeed, irrespective of whether or not there is a wms:KeywordList with wms:Keywords?

It is not clear why this requirement cannot be tested. 
It seems that this requirement refers to the inclusion of a unique resource identifier in an external metadata record (scenario 1 – metadata record as online resource).

It is claimed that this requirement is not testable. This seems wrong.

# Proposed Change
It seems that this could be testable in both scenarios:
- scenario 1: Retrieve the URL to the Discovery service from <metadataURL>. Verify if the metadata record exists and is valid. 
- scenario 2: The ATS could require an optional test run parameter to indicate the corresponding discovery service. A query could check whether there is indeed a corresponding metadata record in the discovery service.";emidiostani

When the resource referenced by a MetadataURL element (in the Extended Capabilities or in the layer element) is accessed, the response that comes back is usually wrapped inside a GetRecordById.
