# Comment
The test method descriptions often are not unambiguously clear with respect to exactly what needs to the asserted. Providing the Xpath references for each selection and assertion necessary would help.

# Comment
ATS not provided as it is still a subject of further implementation specification development.

Coverage: consider of splitting into different tests; support of all mandatory operations and their parameters, correct encoding of the requests and responses
# Proposed Change
It could be possible to work with OGC to implement such a test in OGC CITE. As testing for an OGC standard is not INSPIRE-specific and should be provided by OGC.

# Comment
ATS not provided as it is still a subject of further implementation specification development.
# Proposed Change
Remove test case because of redundancy:
“The test is an abstraction of all the tests in this Abstract Test Suite”"

# Comment
Testability + Ambiguity: both the test purpose and test method need more details and clarification in order to arrive at a test case which “is sufficient to enable a test verdict to be assigned unambiguously to each potentially observable test outcome”

Notes:
Unique identification (name) for this tests needs to be added (e.g. A.1.3 Metadata request).

NR IS should be added as reference (Annex II Part A 2.1)

XPATH expression is missing

IR N2 reference should be part A and not part B
XPATH expression is missing

Update reference to IR N2

Add XPATH reference"

# Comment
“A.1.4 Language parameter” should be a prerequisite
Furthermore there is some overlap with case 2 of test case A.1.4
# Proposed Change
Add 1.4 as prerequisite or consider merging with test case A.1.4"
